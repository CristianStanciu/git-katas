## Kata6: Save my commit
We've lost the holy grail!
Save it!

# Task
- run `. setup.sh`
- save the most important commit that was lost
- What's the difference between saving using reset and using cherry-pick?
- Remove the Â´exercise` folder.
- run `. setup.sh`
- run `git gc`
- Can you still save the lost commit?
- For extra credit what if someone reset their branch, force pushed and you pulled? Can you restore the old state?

## Relevant git commands
-`git reflog
- git cherry-pick
- git reset --hard`
