# Git kata: Amending commits
When we are just working, we make a lot of commits.
Sometimes we just forgot something obvious that we want to fix quickly.

`git commit --amend` allows us to do that - tinkering with the last commit we made.

## 
- run the command `. ./setup.sh`
- What does `git status` tell us?
- What does `git log` tell us?
- Stage the addition of bar.txt
- run `git commit --amend`
- What happened? What does `git log` tell us?
- What happens if you run `git commit --amend` again?
